# Machine component
The Svelte `<Machine>` component is based on [Kingly](https://github.com/brucou/kingly) (though it would also work with any other 
machine library which adheres to the same interface as Kingly). The corresponding file is 
`Machine.svelte`. 

# Install
`import <your-name> from 'svelte-machine'`
